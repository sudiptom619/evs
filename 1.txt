The biological process is controlled by a number of factors, and defeciencies of any of these factors will affect the whole process.

The law states that it is not only that the min amount of the material can be a limiting factor but also the excess amount of the same material can be limiting to the growth and development of the organism.

Every organism has an ecological min and max for every factors and the range btw two limits is called is called limit or zone of tolerance.

Every enviromental factor has two zones:
Zone of tolerance and zone of intolerance

Zone of tolerance: this zone favourable for the development and growth of the organism. It has three categories, optimum zone, critical min and max zone.

A optimum zone is the most favourable zone for the growth and development;
A critical min zone is the lowest min limit below which growth and development of an organism;
A critical max zone is the highest max limit above which growth and development of an organism;

tolerance wrt various factors differs from species to species. Organism that have a wide range of tolerance for all factors have a better chance of survial and are widely distribusted.
